# VL.Rhino.3dm

The VL.Rhino3dm library equips developers with an efficient method for integrating McNeel's Rhinoceros 3D files into their VL projects. This plugin simplifies the process of importing Rhinoceros 3D files, enabling direct access to their geometry, material properties, and user-defined strings within the VL programming environment.

By natively supporting Rhinoceros files in VL, developers can avoid the cumbersome process of tweaking 3D model export settings, a common obstacle in alternative workflows. Additionally, the library enhances functionality with a BIM-like workflow, permitting the attachment of custom information to each model object. This metadata enrichment not only facilitates innovative collaboration methods but also optimizes the tool's application for specific tasks. Importantly, it empowers developers to filter and locate specific objects within VL, leveraging the organizational capabilities inherent to Rhinoceros for structuring model data efficiently.

## Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/managing-nugets.html) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.Rhino.3dm
